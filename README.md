Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was a company known as DriverPass, they are a driving school that focuses on preparing their students for driving tests administered by the DMV. In order to better help their students and to expand their capabilities the client wanted to build a web-based application that would be available 24/7. The main focuses were on purchasing classes, offline availability, and the appointment scheduling system. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well identifying the customers requirements and modeling those requirements in a variety of different diagrams. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would say there is a lot of overlap of requirements in the various sections. I would go back and refine the requirements so that they would only appear once, rather than in multiple sections. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

After looking at the transcript where the client directly stated what they wanted, I started listing out what the client was asking for. Then I took that list of requirements and started laying them out in different ways so that I could see what was the best way to logically define the system so that it would accomplish its intended purposes. Once I identified the different parts of the system and how they would go together logically, I started graphing and modeling the system. Finally, I presented those findings to the client to verify if I had covered everything they wanted. 

It is critical that we carefully consider the user's needs when designing anything. If the system does not do what the user needs it to do, then what use is the system? Systems exist to assist the user in accomplishing tasks. Additionally, the requirements tell us when we are done. Theoretically, we could continue iterating and building forever, but we are still a money driven business and must finish a project at some point. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Similar to what I described above, I always start with the requirements. The requirements will inform my software design. During the design phase I look for necessary elements that were not mentioned in the initial requirements. This could include the logic needed to connect the various components. Sometimes the customer does not know or care how these connections happen. It is up to us to design according to best practices to ensure that the system will both accomplish the customer's requirements and be secure against malicious actors. Then I make the software. I focus on working code, therefore I break my work out into chunks that will always end with a working program. This allows me to test while I work, and to do so regularly. Test early and often! Once I finish, I deliver the software for evaluation.
